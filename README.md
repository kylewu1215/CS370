# Dooley Eats by Team 0100.0

Hi, we are the members of Team 0100.0. This is our Dooley Eats web application implemented using Node.js, Express, Passport, Mongoose, Cloudinary, NodeMailer, EJS and other packages. Our final software artifact allows members of the Emory community to post blogs about restaurant reviews, food recipes as well as upcoming events and/or hangouts. Users can also interact with one another through our like, comment, social connection and other core features. In every way possible, we deliver each of our software components with an intent to maximize and streamline the user experience.
